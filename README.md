A Little OS made for Computer Craft

You want to create a disk with everything, that is your installation disk for the os.
to make things work, you need to create 2 static computers with notificationserver.lua and the smarthomeserver.lua running. You can add notificationsclient.lua to devices and let it run in the background to receive there also notifications. The notification system is build into the os. You have to change the smarthomeserver code a bit, to get everything working, as well as .menu in the /os-folder of your pc or the disk.
